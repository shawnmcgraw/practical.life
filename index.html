        <p>My name is Mary Frances McGraw, and after over two decades of working for others and developing skills to help others in a variety of ways, I decided to go out on my own and start my business, Practical Life LLC. I am certified in etiquette consulting, professional organizing, and life coaching. On the surface these might not seem like they work together, I know that they do.</p>
        <p>Etiquette today can be anything from proper table manners to working in a professional environment to the ever-present online presence and social media.</p>
        <p>Organizing isn't just about tidying up your closet or basement. It's about making your environments, whether it be your home or workplace, more functional. It's also deciding what you really need to keep, what and how to get rid of things, and getting the most out of what you own.</p>
        <p>Life coaching isn't just having someone cheering you on from the sidelines of life, but someone who helps you see your challenges in a positive way, and helping you see the potential in yourself.</p>
        <p>I am here to help you in one, two, or all three of these areas, and I will be happy to guide you into the next phase of your life!</p>

                  Are you or a family member moving into an assisted living facility?
                  If you answered yes to any of these, I can help you sort through your memories and decide what to keep,
                  what to sell/donate, and what to toss. As a professional organizer and life coach,
                  I can help you with the emotions that go along with a significant change like moving,
                  and then help you pack and unpack in your new setting.

                Times they are a changing. Email is the norm and so,
                often, are jeans. With many workplaces moving towards a
                more casual atmosphere, do you know how to navigate some of
                the tricky office politics? What about sending an email vs
                making a phone call? If your workplace is more formal, that
                can be tricky too. I can help you navigate the pitfalls and
                teach you how to find the right options to help you succeed.

                If you have children, you probably want them to have good
                table manners. So how do you teach them while trying to
                enjoy your own meal? Contact me! I'll come to your home,
                when it's convenient for your schedule, and work with your
                child/children. In a matter of a few short sessions, I will
                teach your them which fork to use, which way to pass the
                bread, and how to use a napkin. I will also teach them
                appropriate topics for the dinner table and the importance
                of silence and waiting their turn.

                The election of 2016 not only divided the country but
                also some families. If you want to learn how to work past
                the emotions and get along, during the holidays and
                throughout the rest of the year, I can give you those tools.

                Children and teenagers also need guidance especially in
                the era of social media dominance.  More employers struggle
                to find young employees who know how to interact with
                clients/public. This is due to the fact that so many young
                adults today have spent more time on social media/texting
                than face-to-face interactions.

                  We have all needed someone to talk to about professional
                  and personal issues in our lives. Trusted friends and
                  family members can be helpful but they can also have
                  their own personal/professional views to consider. Life
                  coaches offer the guidance you need to consider and make
                  changes in your life.
